Made with no added sulfites, the big, chewy palate delivers juicy black cherry, ripe blackberry and licorice alongside the warmth of evident alcohol.\",Cascina Gavelli,88,20.0,Piedmont,Barbera d\\'Asti,,Barbera,Coppo\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4974,Italy,\"This opens with rather funky aromas of scorched earth, overripe black-skinned fruit and a whiff of barnyard. The extracted palate offers mature black cherry, toast, espresso and a gamey note alongside tightly packed tannins. A note of roasted coffee bean signals the close.\",Arborina La Foia,88,90.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Curto Marco\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4975,US,\"Pretty scents and flavors of bright cherry fruit come up quickly, with enough concentration to batten down a medium-long finish. A light hint of sweat or animal comes up also.\",Cancilla Vineyard,88,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Day\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4976,Italy,\"This medium-bodied red opens with aromas of toasted oak, mature berry and freshly brewed coffee. The tight palate offers dried black cherry, white pepper, espresso, and a hint of licorice framed in fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.\",Riserva,88,45.0,Piedmont,Roero,,Nebbiolo,Demarie\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4977,France,\"From vines planted to the west of Chablis, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has some tension from the minerality while keeping the white fruit flavors to the fore. Drink now or, better, from late 2016.\",,88,19.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne C\\xc3\\xb4tes d\\xe2\\x80\\x99Auxerre,,Chardonnay,Domaine C\\xc3\\xa9line et Fr\\xc3\\xa9d\\xc3\\xa9ric Gueguen\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4978,France,\"Made from old vines, this ripe and concentrated wine is smooth and creamy. Good acidity balances the rich fruits, giving flavors of apples, pears and apricots cut by a line of citrus. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.\",Les Grands Vignes,88,30.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Chardonnay,Domaine Chenevi\\xc3\\xa8res\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4979,Germany,\"Luscious peach and blossom notes perfume this plucky off-dry Riesling.

Thanisch (Erben M\\xc3\\xbcller-Burggraef)\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4980,France,\"This is a tough wine, packed more with tannins than fruit. A bitter chocolate character comes from over-extraction of the tannins. The fruit is slow in coming, although there are hints of juiciness. Give it until 2017.\",,84,15.0,Bordeaux,Haut-M\\xc3\\xa9doc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ch\\xc3\\xa2teau Fons\\xc3\\xa8che\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4981,France,\"The 56 acres of this estate are in the heart of the Entre deux Mers region. This young and fruity wine has stalky black currant fruits and fresh acidity. There\\'s a light touch of spicy wood and a crisp, red fruit aftertaste.\",,84,16.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ch\\xc3\\xa2teau Guillebot Plaisance\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4982,France,This lean wine lacks fruit to support the dry tannins. That probably comes from the extraction that has also caused some bitterness. It\\'s a hard wine that needs time to soften.,,84,18.0,Bordeaux,M\\xc3\\xa9doc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ch\\xc3\\xa2teau Leboscq\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4983,France,\"From one of two properties in Listrac owned by the Thomas family (the other is Reverdi), this is seriously dark and tannic, with flavors of bitter chocolate extract and wood. It doesn\\'t feel as if it will really soften enough.\",,84,28.0,Bordeaux,Listrac-M\\xc3\\xa9doc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ch\\xc3\\xa2teau L\\'Ermitage\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4984,US,\"Aromas jump between ripe plum and a dark earthy character, from graphite to wet slate. There is a quite a lot of zing on the palate, perhaps even a touch of carbonation, with flavors of cola and sassafras settling on a blackberry-juice backbone.\",,84,32.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Alma Sol\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4985,US,\"Moderately aromatic, this offers notes of red apple, jasmine, and peach. It drinks off dry leaning toward medium sweet, with abundant peach flavors with a creamy feel. It needs a bit more acidity to hold it all together.\",,84,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Riesling,Black Box\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4986,US,\"This moderately aromatic wine offers notes of herbs, peach and soda water. It\\'s medium sweet with lightly spritzy fruit flavors that have an herbal tinge.\",,84,11.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Riesling,Grace Lane\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4987,US,\"Merlot (48%) takes the lead with no other variety making up more than 18% (Syrah) of the blend. It provides notes of bell pepper, dry chocolate, tire rubber and cherry. The feel is plush but with a sharp note running down the middle that distracts.\",Pomatia,84,21.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blend,Helix by Reininger\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4988,US,\"Fresh tangerine and orange blossom notes mingle with slightly yeasty, leesy aromas on this otherwise refreshing wine. It\\'s dry in style with bright lime acidity and a lively finish.\",Patrician Verona Vineyard Dry,84,20.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Heron Hill\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4989,France,\"The gravel soils of the 51-acre vineyard gives this wine its firm character as well as bringing out the fruitiness. While the wood-aging flavors are still strong, this will soften and round out soon for a fresh, fruity wine.\",,84,,Bordeaux,M\\xc3\\xa9doc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ch\\xc3\\xa2teau Tour Castillon\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4990,US,\"There\\'s a definitely alkalinity emerging from the Rh\\xc3\\xb4ne whites on this vineyard west of Gilroy, this one showing chalk along with dried honey. Waxy apple-skin flavors dominate the palate.\",Estate,84,26.0,California,Santa Clara Valley,Central Coast,Marsanne,Sarah\\'s Vineyard\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4991,US,\"Smoke, dried reed and herb tones persist throughout this earthy, semidry Riesling. Pressed apple and pear flavors are savory as well, but brightened by a shower of tart tangerine acidity on the finish.\",Semi-Dry,84,17.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Serenity\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4992,Argentina,Candied cherry and red-plum aromas precede an edgy palate and herbal flavors of plum and berry that are slightly hot and spicy. Raspberry and red-currant flavors on the finish are dilute.,,84,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Tercos\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4993,Argentina,\"Aromas of roadside brush, field greens and raspberry are suggestive of fruit punch. The palate is full but somewhat cloying, while jammy red-fruit flavors come with a green note. The finish is jammy like the palate, with a pronounced chocolaty oak flavor.\",,84,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Ombu\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4994,Argentina,\"This light and refreshing SB offers mild apple and citrus aromas, a snappy, citric palate and basic flavors of green apple and lime. As a whole, it\\'s a cleansing but fairly standard wine.\",Altosur,84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Sauvignon Blanc,Finca Sophenia\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4995,US,\"This easy-drinking, value-minded wine offers notes of plum, tobacco, bell pepper and green herbs, with a vanilla top note. It\\'s straightforward in style, with clunky tannins.\",,84,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Merlot,Sagelands\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n4996,Argentina,\"Peach and powdered sugar aromas are first up, followed by a round palate with oily weight but also zesty acidity.
